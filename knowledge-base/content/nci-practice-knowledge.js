    selling: {
        "sell practice": "Are you thinking about selling your accounting practice? NCI is the nation's leading specialist in accounting practice sales with over 35 years of experience and 1000+ successful transactions. We'll help you get maximum value - typically 0.8x to 1.3x gross revenue, or up to 4x EBITDA for private equity buyers. What aspect of selling interests you most?",
        
        "practice value": "Your practice value depends on several key factors: sales/earnings (typically 0.8x-1.3x gross revenue), profit margins, service types (monthly recurring services are valued higher), client base quality, staff retention, and location. Practices in metro areas can sell for 10-20% more. Private equity buyers are now paying 3-5x EBITDA! Want a free valuation?",
        
        "business broker": "Don't use a general business broker! Here's why: They lack accounting industry experience, can't properly value practices, don't understand client retention (which affects your sale price), are slow and bureaucratic, and can't arrange specialized financing. NCI has 35+ years specializing ONLY in accounting practices with 1000+ successful sales!",
        
        "practice valuation": "We value practices using industry-specific factors: average gross revenue over 2 years (0.8x-1.3x multiple), profit margins, revenue mix (monthly services valued higher than seasonal tax work), client diversity, staff stability, and location. Higher margin practices (55%+) get top multiples. Private equity involvement has driven some to 4x EBITDA. Want your free valuation?",
        
        "why nci": "NCI's advantages: 35+ years of accounting practice expertise, 1000+ successful sales, accurate industry-specific valuations, client retention strategies, access to qualified buyers, specialized financing sources, and complete transition support. We're not general brokers - we ONLY do accounting practices!",
        
        "client retention": "Client retention is crucial for maximizing sale price! We help with proper transition planning, gradual introductions, maintaining relationships during sale, and ensuring buyer understands your client needs. Poor transitions can cause client exodus and reduce your sale price significantly.",
        
        "practice preparation": "To prepare for sale: Clean up financials, diversify revenue streams, document procedures, strengthen client relationships, ensure staff stability, optimize profitability, and organize all legal documents. We'll help you maximize value before listing!",
        
        "retirement planning": "Your practice IS your retirement account! With stock market volatility, your practice represents decades of hard work and relationships. We'll help you get maximum value and plan the perfect exit strategy. Many of our sellers use proceeds to fund their retirement dreams!"

    // BUYING PRACTICE RESPONSES  
    // ===========================================
    buying: {
        "buy practice": "Buying an accounting practice can fast-track your success! Key considerations: thorough due diligence, understanding practice structure, emphasizing profitability over revenue, investigating cash flow, evaluating client base, assessing staff, and planning financing. Typical terms: 20-40% down, balance over 2-7 years. How can we help you find the perfect practice?",
        
        "practice financing": "We offer specialized financing through our preferred lender - up to 90% financing available! Typical terms: 20-40% down payment, balance over 2-7 years. Requirements: good credit, reasonable net worth, and practice cash flow that supports debt service. Traditional banks often won't finance these deals, but we have the solution!",
        
        "due diligence": "Essential due diligence steps: Review 3+ years of financials, analyze client retention rates, assess staff stability, understand practice operations, verify legal compliance, evaluate lease terms, check for pending issues, and meet key clients if possible. We guide you through every step!",
        
        "what to look for": "Look for: profitable practices (not just high revenue), diverse client base, recurring monthly services, experienced staff willing to stay, good location, reasonable lease terms, growth potential, and sellers motivated to ensure smooth transition. Avoid practices dependent on 1-2 major clients!",
        
        "purchase terms": "Standard terms: 20-40% down payment, remaining balance over 2-7 years, often with performance guarantees. Many sellers now prefer mostly cash deals with 10% holdback for guarantee period. We can arrange up to 90% financing for qualified buyers!",
        
        "practice types": "Consider: solo practices (often more profitable), established firms with recurring clients, practices with monthly bookkeeping services (steady cash flow), growing firms in good locations, and practices where owner is ready to retire. Remote practices are increasingly attractive due to lower overhead!"
